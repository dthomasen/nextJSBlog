title: 'Two Forms of Pre-rendering'

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

```js
// lib/docs.js

import fs from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

export function getDocBySlug(slug) {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.md$/, '');
  const docsDirectory = join(process.cwd(), 'docs');
  const fullPath = join(docsDirectory, `${realSlug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

  return { slug: realSlug, meta: data, content };
}
```
